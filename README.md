The concept behind the JPA (Java Persistence API) is that each Java object has its state stored in a database, ensuring data persistence. Modifications to Java objects update corresponding data objects. This means that upon application closure, all data is already saved. JPA facilitates transaction handling using Java objects, abstracting away the need to manage raw data conversions manually.
